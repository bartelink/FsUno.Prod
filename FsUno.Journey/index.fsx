# Functional Event Sourcing: The journey 

This is the log of the journey toward building [FsUno.Prod](https://github.com/thinkbeforecoding/FsUno.Prod).

Because the journey is more important than the destination, I'll write here 
the things that happen along the way, things I stumbled upon, questions about design
and implementation as well as options.

The code of the project [can be found on github](https://github.com/thinkbeforecoding/FsUno.Prod)

Join the discussion in the [FunctionalEventSourcing room on JabbR](https://jabbr.net/#/rooms/FunctionalEventSourcing)

You can find the table of contents on the right.
